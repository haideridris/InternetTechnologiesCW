How my website runs:

WARNING: If the website throws a session permission denied error, make sure you are not logged into
any other sites that are not this coursework website. This will fix the error and allow my website to
be fully functional.

A registered account can choose to log in with either their username or email address
and their password.
A normal user will be taken to the products page once logged in and admin will be taken to 
the admin page once logged in.
An admin can view all pages but a user can not view the admin page.
You may log in and out on any page.
My login form is dynamic, it shows a log in form if an account is not logged in and a log out
button if an account is logged in.

My products page is dynamic.
Before an account is logged in, the products page will not allow products to be displayed. 
Once logged in either account (user/admin) can display all products or search for a single product.
Note the admin is also able to navigate to the admin page by clicking a hyperlink in the sidebar named
admin.

The sign up form is dynamic. It will show error messages on screen if the user makes a mistake
trying to sign up and a success message upon successful sign up.

The admin page is also dynamic. It will also show error messages or a success message upon adding,
deleting of a user or product. The Registered users and products tables displayed on screen will thus update
and reflect the changes made by the admin.

Note when admin wants to add a new image to the products table, he must specify the filepath for the image.
Therefore the admin must place the new image they want to be displayed in the images folder of my website
folder for it to be displayed in the products page.
